			When I was younger, I liked <em>Frog and Toad</em>, <em>Garfield</em>, <em>The Lorax</em>, <em>Horton Hears a Who</em>, and many others. My sister liked<em> The Baby Animal Rescue Fairies</em>. She is still obsessed with it. She made a whole <strong><em>WEBSITE</em></strong> about it! You should listen to these sorts of books, then start reading them yourself.(Ask an older sibling to read to you, it will probably be SUPER annoying for them)

		<h3 class="headers">Graphic Novels</h3>
		<p>
			Once you've started reading on your own, you should wait a little while and then try out graphic novels. Graphic novels are a little longer, but they still have pictures.(phew!) Sometimes they have chapters, but not all. I liked <em>Diary Of a Wimpy Kid</em>, <em>Bone</em>, <em>Big Nate</em>, <em>Captain Underpants</em>, <em>Tintin</em>, <em>Asterix</em>, and more.
